    <h1>Halo Games</h1>
    <p>
        Halo is a military science fiction first-person shooter video game franchise created by Bungie and now managed and
        developed by 343 Industries, a subsidiary of Microsoft Studios. The series centers on an interstellar war between
        humanity and a theocratic alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. The Covenant, led by their religious leaders
        called the Prophets, worship an ancient civilization known as the Forerunners, who perished in combat with the
        parasitic Flood. <br><br>

        The central focus of the franchise builds off the experiences of Master Chief John-117, one of a group of
        super soldiers codenamed Spartans, and his artificial intelligence (AI) companion, Cortana. Other characters,
        such as Noble Six from Halo: Reach, are also introduced in the series. The term "Halo" refers to the Halo rings:
        large, habitable super-weapons that were created to destroy the parasitic Flood.
        They are similar to the Orbitals in Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, and less so to author Larry Niven's
        Ringworld concept.<br><br>

        The games in the series have been praised as being among the best first-person shooters on a video game console,
        and are considered the Xbox's "killer app". This led to the term "Halo killer" being used to describe
        console games that aspire, or are considered, to be better than Halo. Fueled by the success of Halo: Combat Evolved,
        and by immense marketing campaigns from publisher Microsoft, its sequels went on to record-breaking sales.
        The games have sold over 65 million copies worldwide, with the games alone grossing almost $3.4 billion.
